"""Stress tests for roctx_recordfn's seqNr forward-to-backward correlation.

Covers three conditions known to break similar tracers:
  * many matched fwd/bwd pairs across training steps;
  * detached graphs (forward snapshots whose backward never fires);
  * concurrent Python threads exercising the shard mutexes.

Counters from dump_stats() are the source of truth; wire strings are
covered by test_torch_trace_coverage.py.

CI: registered with ctest; not in test_categories.yaml so it runs only
    on the full ctest invocation. Needs a GPU; ctest timeout 600 s.
Coverage: not in the coverage XML (GPU-only, kept out of the coverage
    aggregation set in CMakeLists.txt).
Why: the coverage test asserts marker shape but not the correlation
    map's behaviour under load; these stressors catch leaks, drops,
    and shard-mutex regressions that wire-string checks can't see.
